					<h3>Who am I?</h3>
					<p class="about">
						Mostly known as serchpics on Instagram, Sergio (which is me) is an 18 year old photographer currently based in Dublin, Ireland, but born in Spain, Madrid, where I sometimes reside for periods of time.
						<br><br>With the World as my workplace, I pursue a wide variety of photography styles but center my attention in portraits, landscapes, cars and animals (wild life and pets).
						<br><br>My interest in this fine art started in the summer of 2018, and since then photography as been part of my life. Initially (and for a long time) it was just another one of my hobbies, but with time it has become more important to the point of doing proffesional work. 
						<br><br>From portraits and car sessions to taking pictures of families and their pets, I am able to perform in a range of areas. Also, during my years as a photographer I've mastered the art of editing photos using Adobe Lightroom, and this service has also been hired in a number of ocassions.
						<br><br>
						As for my gear, I use the Sony Alpha 6400 with two different lenses: the Sony 18-135 mm, f-3.5/5.6 and the Sony E 35mm F1.8 OSS.

						<h3>Prices</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="prices" id="prices1">
						<h2>Portraits (individual, couples, friends, family, etc)</h2>
						<p>This pictures will be taken in the streets of Dublin/Madrid (depends on where I am at the moment of the photoshoot. Feel free to ask me about my whereabouts to book a session) during day/night time to have available different scenarios and backgrounds, props and apportunities to take better portraits. Also, this helps to create a more relaxed and friendly atmosphere, which is what I look for when working with my clients. You can bring as many props and outfits as you want and we will work together with whatever we have to get the best portraits possible.
						<br>
						<br>
						The price is 40€ for 50 minutes of actual photography, and it also includes the careful selection and edition of the pictures with the proffesional software Lighroom. For starters, you can decide to go for one session (50 min) and if you are enjoying it and want to keep going we can arrange it on the go (again, relaxed and flexible photoshoot remember?). After that, I will send all the edited pictures in less than a week using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wetransfer.com/">WeTransfer</a>, a method to send you the final result using email so that the quality doesn't decrease.
						<br>
						<br>
						Disclaimer! Depending on where you want the session to be, extra cost may be added to the price, so <a href="#contact">message me</a> to clarify this or any other doubt.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="prices" id="prices2">
						<h2>Cars</h2>
						<p>If you are a car lover (specifically your car) and would like to get your car photographed, I'm just what you are looking for! Tag along with your car and we will take it to different locations around the city to make it look as good as it could. Also, you may be part of the pictures if you want not only your car to be photographer but also you with it. Because car photoshoots are usually longer, the price for this is 65€ for 1 hour and a half of shooting, and it also includes the careful selection and edition of the pictures with the proffesional software Lighroom. After that, I will send all the edited pictures in less than a week using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wetransfer.com/">WeTransfer</a>, a method to send you the final result using email so that the quality doesn't decrease.
						<br>

					</div>
					<div class="prices" id="prices3">
						<h2>Events (birthdays, weddings, sports, parties, concerts, etc)</h2>
						<p>For any event that you are going to organize/attend to, having pictures of this special day is utterly beautiful! Whether you are getting married, you have a big concert coming up or you play any type of sport, I am the man for the job.

						<h2>Lightroom edition</h2>
						<p>If you have your own pictures and want me to edit them, then this is just perfect for you. For 1€ per photo, I will edit your picture in two different ways and send them both to you via email. If you want 6 different photos edited, the price would be 5€ instead of 6€. If you have any specific requierements or any question, please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to clarify it.</p>

						<h2>Pets</h2>
						<p>We all know how great is to have pictures of your pet around, and because I know that too I think that a session like this is perfect for upping the quality of your pet pictures. The price for this service is 30€ for 40 minutes of pictures, and it also includes the careful selection and edition of the photos with the proffesional software Lighroom. After that, I will send all the edited pictures in less than a week using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wetransfer.com/">WeTransfer</a>, a method to send you the final result using email so that the quality doesn't decrease.

						Disclaimer! Depending on where you want the session to be, extra cost may be added to the price, so <a href="#contact">message me</a> to clarify this or any other doubt.</p>
